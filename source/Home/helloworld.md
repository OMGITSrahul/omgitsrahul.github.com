Title: Hello World!
Tags: finally!
Slug: hello-world

Hi there! Wow, I don't know what made me do this, But I guess I'm back to blogging again!
Hmm, but it's like 7 am now, and I haven't slept all night so, I can't really think of anything to day.
Unless you want to hear me yapping on about how this whole blog was made. It looks simple, but its anything but simple. 
The content, aka the bare post itself looks like this:
![The naked pos](./images/barepost.png)                  
and is first processed by [Pelican](http://pelican.notmyidea.org/en/2.8/index.html), and then a few scripts tweak the 
html and css, because the original deign generated by pelican is nice, but has a few large moles.
